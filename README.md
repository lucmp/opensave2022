# opensave2022
An Open/Save dialog proc for Tcl/Tk applications.

This is not a full and functional application. It's just a drop-in replacement for the default tk_getOpenFile and tk_getSaveFile open/save dialogs available in all Tcl/Tk stock installations. If you write Tcl/Tk applications, it may be useful to you. If you don't, then you probably don't need it.

This is a work in progress. Hopefully, will be released before the end of 2022.
